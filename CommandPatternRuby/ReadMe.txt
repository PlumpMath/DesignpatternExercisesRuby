- This is an example of command design pattern in ruby

- The concept here is exactly same as strategy pattern example you saw earlier, but of course, some implementation changes as per 
command design pattern

-Expected output is as follows:

Extracting as CSV...
Extracting as TSV...
Extracting as database...

- Hint: Extraction interface is analogous to command interface and subsequent concrete classes are analogous to concrete command

- The correct extraction algorithm needs to be called in a way that reflects use of command design pattern.
